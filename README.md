# Embedded HW4: Kinetic Sculpture

This is the code repository for the kinetic sculpture project. When powered, this sculpture will animate whenever the button at <a href="http://165.227.76.232:3000/mhl2157">this link</a> is pressed.

Big thanks to <a href="https://maxs.world/">Max Bennett</a> for putting the API together and for providing <a href="https://github.com/mbennett12/kinetic-sculpture-webapi/blob/main/example_HTTP_get.ino">sample HTML GET</a> code for Arduino devices.
